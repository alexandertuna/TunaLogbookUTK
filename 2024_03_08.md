- [ ] Key takeaways
  - [ ] Theory: muon collisions are cool - Higgs factory and discovery
    - [x] VBF >> annihilation at muon collider
    - [x] 10 TeV muons similar to 50-200 TeV protons because muons fundamental
  - [ ] Accelerator: muon R&D in the past decade
    - [x] Muon Accelerator Program (MAP)
    - [x] Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE)
    - [x] Cool results, especially MICE. Need to keep going
  - [ ] Detectors
    - [ ] BIB from muon decays creates lots of signals in the detectors
    - [ ] Shielding to reduce BIB is a big deal
