Tuna consumed more info about muon collider landscape based on the links at muoncollider.us/resources . Two areas of study which seem to be big unanswered questions are (1) muon accelerators and (2) detectors, especially in the presence of BIB. Tova/Larry can ask around about projects related to muon accelerators, though this is naturally higher risk for Tuna since he hasn't worked on accelerators before. To start, he could focus on detectors. Specifically, he can look at M(Zjj) vs M(Hjj), especially in the context of HCal calibration, since this seems like a prime culprit for the existing and uninspiring M(Zjj) vs M(Hjj) separation. Some people have also started looking at this! Repo with helpful mucol code: https://github.com/trholmes/mucolstudies
