- [ ] hcal calibration
  - [x] Fork trholmes/mucolstudies
  - [x] Clone alexandertuna/mucolstudies
  - [ ] Run something
    - [ ] Dont use singularity anymore, use apptainer
    - [ ] .rootlogon.C fails because it references /work/trholmes/
    - [ ] Can this be conditional if path exists?
  - [ ] apptainer
    - [ ] `apptainer build k4toroid.sif docker://madbaron/k4test-ubuntu:latest`
      - [x] `Creating SIF file...`
      - [x] mksquashfs is doing something, not clear what
      - [ ] Waiting
    - [ ] `apptainer run --no-home -B /tank/data/snowmass21/muonc:/data -B /home/$USER -B /work/$USER /home/$USER/mucol/k4toroid.sif`
  - [ ] First thoughts - how could you industrialize?
    - [ ] Matplotlib for viz instead of ROOT.TCanvas
    - [ ] numpy arrays for intermediate data instead of ROOT.TH1
    - [ ] Multiprocessing files/events
    - [ ] readFromSLCIO / readFromPickle / writeToPickle / plot
  - [ ] Can you industrialize an example and compare before/after?
- [ ] Miscellanous

  - [x] I noticed the cern2023 software tutorial datasets are available from the cvmfs mount on snowmass
    - [x] `ls /cvmfs/muoncollider.cern.ch/datasets/tutorial_20230705/`
    - [x] How convenient
    - [x] Lots of hbb data
