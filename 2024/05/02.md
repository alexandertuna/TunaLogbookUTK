- [ ] Check that sim hits / digits dichotomy makes sense
  - [ ] Are all sim hits associated to a digit?
  - [ ] Or do sim hits include passive material?
  - [ ] ... why do sim hits follow detector pattern?
  - [ ] Why dont digi/rec hits have x/y?
- [ ] You want the true amount of energy depositied in the ecal and hcal separately
  - [ ] Can the truth record tell you that?
