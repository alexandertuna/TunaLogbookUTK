- [x] muoncollider roundtable
  - [x] How is lctuple different?
  - [x] Possible to get all cells?
  - [x] To see sim->digi conversion: read digi py/cpp and read 10 TeV paper draft
    - [x] https://www.overleaf.com/project/64cd2fe043946a5b57fc0e80
- [x] Detailed neutron plots
  - [x] Add all clus energy (clx), all PF energy (pfx)
- [x] Try `black`
- [ ] Remove `settings`
- [ ] Break up the big method into `process_file`, `process_event`
- [ ] Make plots of n(clus), n(pfo)- [ ] Ask Federico to add you to overleaf
- [ ] Check that sim hits / digits dichotomy makes sense
  - [ ] Are all sim hits associated to a digit?
  - [ ] Or do sim hits include passive material?
  - [ ] ... why do sim hits follow detector pattern?
  - [ ] Why dont digi/rec hits have x/y?
- [ ] You want the true amount of energy depositied in the ecal and hcal separately
  - [ ] Can the truth record tell you that?
