- [ ] muoncollider roundtable
  - [ ] How is lctuple different?
  - [ ] Possible to get all cells?
  - [ ] To see sim->digi conversion: read digi py/cpp and read 10 TeV paper draft
    - [ ] https://www.overleaf.com/project/64cd2fe043946a5b57fc0e80
- [ ] Ask Federico to add you to overleaf
- [ ] Detailed neutron plots
  - [ ] Add all clus energy (clx), all PF energy (pfx)
  - [ ] Make plots of n(clus), n(pfo)
- [ ] Check that sim hits / digits dichotomy makes sense
  - [ ] Are all sim hits associated to a digit?
  - [ ] Or do sim hits include passive material?
  - [ ] ... why do sim hits follow detector pattern?
  - [ ] Why dont digi/rec hits have x/y?
- [ ] You want the true amount of energy depositied in the ecal and hcal separately
  - [ ] Can the truth record tell you that?
