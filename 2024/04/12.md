- [x] mucol utk
  - [x] double checking that hcal cells not in any clusters
  - [x] started trying to make a tova-stle plot of pions
    - [x] true pion energy vs sim energy, digi energy, cluster energy, pfo energy
    - [x] complicated for hcal since cells not in clusters
- [x] Any notable speedups in caloStudies.py?
  - [x] Not really! Just looping over events occupies most of the time
  - [x] 30s for 500 events with normal processing
  - [x] 20s for 500 events with all code removed except event loop
  - [x] Default: 21 Hz
  - [x] With setReadCollectionNames: 23 Hz
  - [x] No processing inside event loop: 36 Hz
  - [x] With setReadCollectionNames and no processing inside event loop: 129 Hz
- [x] There is fuckery in the tutorial
  - [x] `from utils import get_oldest_mcp_parent` remove this
- [ ] Can you make a Tova-style plot for pions?
